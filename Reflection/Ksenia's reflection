    When working on this project, I found that a lot of the work had to be edited when going from Khanacademy to Github. So that added 
more work for me to do. During the presentation, a lot of information said was semi-accurate. I mentioned everthing I wanted to mention.
I learned how to create buttons, timers, mouvement amounsgt other things during the time I worked on this project. I found that everything 
went well and yet I also feel that the project can always be improved. 

    Thank you for a good semester M. Osudar. Have a good summer!
